Our approach here is suitable for students with limited statistical background: we first explore the general characteristics of borrowers, then we contrast the characteristics of funded borrowers to those of non-funded borrowers, using both descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing. Since lenders choose whom they fund, the results of this analysis will reveal the types of borrowers which lenders prefer, and may suggest motivations for lending.\n\n## Setup\n\nBefore we dive into the analysis, we need to import all the required packages. This includes packages for statistical analysis and visualization - many of which you will be familiar with from earlier sections.\n\n### Importing the required packages\n\nThe packages we use in this walk through are:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(\"ggplot2\")\nlibrary(\"plotly\")\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"readr\")\nlibrary(\"colorblindr\")\nlibrary(\"viridis\")\nlibrary(\"memisc\")\nlibrary(\"kableExtra\")\nlibrary(\"scales\")\noptions(readr.show_col_types = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Reading the data\n\nWe use the `lender loans` and `loans` files for this analysis. The `lender loans` file contains detailed loans and lender information with corresponding borrowers. The `loans` file has detailed borrower information and their respective loans, however this file does not contain any lender information.\n\nOur prompt relates to motivations for lending to developing-nation entrepreneurs, therefore to focus on the appropriate borrowers we subset our data. While the term \"developing nation\" is not clearly defined, we use data from world bank to separate the borrowers' countries into low income and high income groups in the `lender loans` file. We perform this step using a `left_join` and use the updated data set for the rest of our analysis\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwdi <- read_csv(\"data/CLASS.csv\") # World Bank Indicator data\nlender_loans <- read_csv(\"data/lender_loans.csv\") #Kiva Lender Loans data\nkiva_loan <- read_csv((\"data/loans.csv\")) #Loans data\n\n#Merging data to incorporate income indicators in our lender loan's file using country names\nkiva_ll<- left_join(lender_loans, wdi, by = c(\"location.country\" = \"Economy\")) \n\nkiva_ll <- subset(kiva_ll, select = -c(52,54:55)) #Removing irrelevant columns\ncolnames(kiva_ll)[52] <- \"income_indicator\" #renaming income group column to income indicator\n```\n\n\n## Analysis\n\n### Descriptive Statistics\n\nWe begin by getting an overview of the characteristics of all would-be borrowers, including their gender, sector, country, and requested loan amount. First we look at how the total amount of loans received varies between high income and low income countries using a bar chart. From this, we observe that countries belonging to lower income group receive the majority of loan funds.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#sorting income indicators into two broad groups - High Income and Low income for ease of analysis\nkiva_ll$income_indicator[kiva_ll$income_indicator==\"Lower middle income\"]<-\"Low income\"\nkiva_ll$income_indicator[kiva_ll$income_indicator==\"Upper middle income\"]<-\"High income\"\n\n# Loan Amount Calculation\nincome_group <- kiva_ll %>% group_by(income_indicator) %>%\n        summarize(tot_loans = sum(loan_amount)/1000) %>%\n  arrange(desc(tot_loans))\n\n#Bar Chart country indicator vs Loan Amount\nggplot(na.omit(income_group)) +\n  aes(income_indicator, tot_loans, fill =income_indicator) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\") +\n  xlab(\"Country Income Indicator\") +\n  ylab(\"Total loan amount in USD\") +\n  scale_fill_OkabeIto(order = c(1,2)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Total loan amount vs Country Income Indicator\") +\n   theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Kiva_motivation_hypotest_files/figure-html/indicator -1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n\nKeeping our prompt in mind, we subset our data to these low income countries and perform the rest of the analysis on that subset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkiva_ll <- kiva_ll %>% filter(income_indicator==\"Low income\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nBecause we are interested in differences between funded and non-funded borrowers, we add an indicator for borrower type (sex of the borrower: male, female, or group borrower) and funding status to our data set.\n\n**Borrower Type**\n\nOur current master file `lender_loans_with_wbi.csv` only contains the total number of borrowers. However, the `loans.csv` file contains a split of the count of female and male borrowers. Using this information we can create a new variable which indicates whether a borrower is an individual male borrower, individual female borrower or part of a group. We use the `mutate` function to create this new column and name it `bor_type`. We update the values based on `if_else` conditions. We apply these conditions on the male borrower and female borrower count column. The conditions we use are:\n\n-   If the value in the `m_borrower_count` column is equal to 1 and `f_borrower_count` is equal to 0, we update the value in the `bor_type` column as *Male*\n\n-   If the value in the `f_borrower_count` column is equal to 1 and `m_borrower_count` is equal to 0, we update the value in the `bor_type` column as *Female*\n\n-   For any other case, we update the value in the `bor_type` column as *Group*\n\n\n::: {.cell warnings='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Get unique borrower id and total male female borrower count\nkiva_loan_sub <- kiva_loan %>% group_by(borrower_image_id) %>% \n  summarize(total_m = sum(borrower_m_count),total_f = sum(borrower_f_count))\n\n#Create new borrower type column based on conditions\nkiva_loan_sub <- kiva_loan_sub %>%\n  mutate(bor_type = if_else(total_m == 1 & total_f == 0, \"Male\",\n                       if_else(total_m == 0 & total_f == 1, \"Female\",\"Group\")))\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter creating the indicator variable, we merge those values to the `lender_loans` data frame and check for NAs. This will help us verify if all the values in our left data frame have found corresponding values or not. For the purpose of this analysis we will drop any NAs in the data since it is not possible to obtain that information elsewhere.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Checking if each borrower image id maps to 1 Gender or group\nkiva_loan_sub %>% \n  group_by(borrower_image_id) %>% \n  summarize(count=n_distinct(bor_type)) %>% \n  arrange(desc(count))\n\n#Merging sex group to main data\nkiva_ll_merged <- left_join(x = kiva_ll, y = kiva_loan_sub, by=\"borrower_image_id\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Funding Status**\n\nOur data contains a `status` column which indicates the current status of the loan. First we look at the unique values in this column and the number of loans associated with each respectively. Further, we use these values to create an indicator variable for whether a loan has been funded or not.\n\n\n::: {.cell messgae='false'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Looking at unique values and respective loan count in status column\nstatus <- kiva_ll_merged %>% group_by(status) %>% summarize(count = length(unique(loan_id))) %>% arrange(desc(count))\n\nstatus[\"status\"][status[\"status\"] == \"in_repayment\"] <- \"in repayment\"\n\nstatus %>% kbl(caption = \"Loans Status\", col.names = c(\"Status\", \"No. of loans\")) %>% \n  kable_classic(bootstrap_options =\"striped\",full_width = F, html_font = \"helvetica\",position = \"left\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\" lightable-classic\" style=\"font-family: helvetica; width: auto !important; \">\n<caption>Loans Status</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Status </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> No. of loans </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> paid </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 48371 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> in repayment </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18844 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> defaulted </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1144 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> refunded </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 748 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> fundraising </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 171 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> expired </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 132 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> funded </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 62 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n<br/>\n\nThe status column contains 7 unique values. We look at the data dictionary and Kiva website to get a better idea of what each term means. Based on that we make the classification of these terms to our 2 classes funded and not-funded:\n\n-   Funded: $\\texttt{funded, in_repayment, paid, defaulted, refunded}$\n\n-   Not Funded: $\\texttt{expired, fundraising}$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#creating a vector for values which are associated with funded loans\nfunded_vec <- c(\"paid\",\"in_repayment\",\"funded\",\"defaulted\", \"refunded\")\n\n#create indicator variable for Funded or not funded loans\nkiva_ll_funding <- kiva_ll_merged %>% mutate(funding_status = if_else(\n                       kiva_ll_merged$status %in% funded_vec, \"Funded\",\"Not Funded\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce we have added our new indicator columns, we will use descriptive statistics to visualize these and identify trends,to gain some insight into borrower characteristics\n\nWe look at the distribution of the funding status of loans among borrower types. <!-- We will visualize this data in a tabular format since our data contains two categorical variables. -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Creating master df for all plots\nbor_chr <- kiva_ll_funding %>% group_by(borrower_image_id,loan_id,income_indicator, location.country,sector,bor_type, funding_status) %>%\n  summarize(tot_loans = sum(loan_amount)/100,borr_count = max(borrower_count)) %>% arrange(desc(tot_loans))\n\nbor_chr <- na.omit(bor_chr)\n#Bar Chart Funding Status vs Loan Amount by Borrower Type\nggplot(bor_chr) +\n  aes(funding_status, tot_loans, fill =bor_type) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  xlab(\"Funding Status\") +\n  ylab(\"Total loan amount in USD (000's)\") +\n  scale_fill_OkabeIto(order = c(3,1,5)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Total loan amount vs Funding Status by Borrower Type\") +\n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 16)) + \n  labs(fill = \"Borrower Type\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Kiva_motivation_hypotest_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the above plot we observe that female borrowers account for the majority of funded loan dollars, while group and male borrowers account for the greatest share of unfunded total loan dollars.

Our first interpretation could be that this indicates that lenders have a high preference for loans in these sectors. However we must note that this could be due to various reasons such as there being only a small number of loans in the sector which increase their probability of getting funded.\n\nWe have looked at how the proportion of loans varies across sectors, next we look at how the average loan amount varies across sectors, for our indicators. Since the number of borrowers is not evenly distributed across types in our data, looking at the average loan amount helps to make the comparisons more material.\n\n\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nloan_funded <- bor_chr %>%  filter(funding_status==\"Funded\")\nloan_nonfunded <- bor_chr %>%  filter(funding_status == \"Not Funded\")\n\n\npercap_loan_fun <- loan_funded %>% mutate(amount_per_cap= tot_loans/borr_count)\npercap_loan_nonfun <- loan_nonfunded %>% mutate(amount_per_cap= tot_loans/borr_count)\n\n\n#Funded by borrower type\npercap_funded_sec <- percap_loan_fun %>% group_by(sector, bor_type) %>% \n  summarize(avg_loan = sum(amount_per_cap))\n\n\nggplot(percap_funded_sec) +\n  aes(reorder(sector, avg_loan), avg_loan, fill =bor_type) + \n  geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  xlab(\"Sector\") +\n  ylab(\"Avg loan amount (in USD)\") +\n  scale_fill_OkabeIto(order = c(3,1,5)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Avg.

Female borrowers have the highest average loan amount in the Retail and Food sector. Male borrowers have a higher average loan amount compared to females in Manufacturing, Transportation and Construction sectors. For not funded loans, the highest average loan amount is dominated by male borrowers. This reiterates the suggestion that lenders are motivated to lend to female borrowers.\n\n<!-- We also look at how the loan amount varies across countries -->\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have looked at the borrower characteristics visually through our graphs and descriptive statistics. We now use Hypothesis Testing to further analyze our data.\n\n### Hypothesis Testing\n\nHypothesis testing is a statistical inference method used to test an assumption about the data or more specifically the population parameters. To understand our lender motivations we will test several hypotheses.\n\nHere is an outline of the basic steps that are performed during a hypothesis test:\n\n-   Specify the null hypothesis\n-   Specify the alternative hypothesis\n-   Set the significance level (also known as $\\alpha$ )\n-   Calculate the test statistics and the corresponding p-value\n-   Draw the conclusion\n\nAs you recall form your Introduction to Statistics class, the p-value (probability value) is the level of significance within a statistical hypothesis test, representing the probability of obtaining a given result under the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than our level of significance, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, whereas if the p-value is less than our level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis. This is also referred to as the decision rule. For our analysis we will set the significance level at 0.001 or 0.1%.\n\nFirst, we are interested in understanding how individual loans differ based on the gender of the applicant. The total loan amount is biased by the number of borrowers i.e. the number of female and group borrowers is much larger than the male borrowers, therefore we look at the average loan amount per borrower. To keep the analysis simple we subset our data to only Male and Female borrowers and test our hypothesis using a two-sample t-test. A t-test is a statistical test that compares the means of two samples. By subsetting and calculating the average loan amounts, we are comparing sample means using t-test to check our hypothesis.\n\nOur null and alternative hypothesis are:\n\n$H_{0}:$ $µ_{female} - µ_{male} = 0$\n\n<!-- The true difference between the average loan amount for Male borrowers and Female borrowers is equal to 0 -->\n\n$H_{1}:$ $µ_{female} - µ_{male} > 0$\n\n<!-- The true difference between the average loan amount for Male borrowers and Female borrowers is less than 0 -->\n\n$H_{0}$ *is known as the null hypothesis and* $H_{1}$ *is know as the alternative hypothesis.*\n\nBefore we proceed with the t-test, we need to check some assumptions to ensure we are performing a valid t-test. The assumptions for t-test are:\n\n-   The data values are independent. The amount of the loan borrowed by one borrower does not depend on the loan amount borrowed by another.\n-   We assume that number of borrowers in our data represent a random sample from the population of borrowers at Kiva.com\n-   The values are continuous. The loan amount is a continuous variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo perform the t-test we first separate our data into the respective groups of female and male borrowers. We use the `t-test` function to perform the t-test and calculate the t-statistic and p-values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Subset df to female borrowers\nfemale <- subset(pc_gender,pc_gender$bor_type == \"Female\")\n#Create df with only loan amount per borrower\nfemale_loan <- female %>% pull(amount_per_cap)\n\n#Subset df to male borrowers\nmale <- subset(pc_gender,pc_gender$bor_type == \"Male\")\n#Create df with only loan amount per borrower\nmale_loan <- male %>% pull(amount_per_cap)\n\n#hypothesis test\nhyp <- t.test(female_loan,male_loan, alternative = \"less\")\nhyp\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\tWelch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  female_loan and male_loan\nt = -30.991, df = 22862, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is less than 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n      -Inf -3.855926\nsample estimates:\nmean of x mean of y \n 9.506357 13.578418 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe one-sided t-test results in a p-value below the level of significance 0.001 so we to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is a systematic difference in the value of loans granted to male and female borrowers, with male borrowers receiving higher value loans.\n\nNow we look at the proportion of loans in the funded and non funded sector. Here we are interested in how the proportion of loans given to female borrowers differs between the funded and non funded category. We will be using a Z test to test two proportions. A z-test is a hypothesis test in which the z-statistic follows a normal distribution.\n\nOur null and alternative hypothesis are:\n\n$H_{0} :$ $p_{female\\ funded} = p_{male\\ funded}$\n\n$H_{1}:$ $p_{female\\ funded} > p_{male\\ funded}$\n\nWe calculate the proportion among funded and not funded loans and test out hypothesis using the `prop.test` function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#calculate total female loans in data\ntotal_female_loans <- bor_chr  %>% filter(bor_type==\"Female\") \ntotal_female_loans <- length(unique(total_female_loans$loan_id))\ntotal_female_loans_funded <- female  %>% filter(funding_status==\"Funded\") \ntotal_female_loans_funded <- length(unique(total_female_loans_funded$loan_id))\n\n#calculate total male loans in data\ntotal_male_loans <- bor_chr  %>% filter(bor_type==\"Male\") \ntotal_male_loans <- length(unique(total_male_loans$loan_id))\ntotal_male_loans_funded <- male  %>% filter(funding_status==\"Funded\") \ntotal_male_loans_funded <- length(unique(total_male_loans_funded$loan_id))\n\n\n#Test for proportions\nprop.test(x = c(total_female_loans_funded,total_male_loans_funded) , n = c(total_female_loans,total_male_loans), alternative = \"greater\", conf.level = 0.95)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\t2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction\n\ndata:  c(total_female_loans_funded, total_male_loans_funded) out of c(total_female_loans, total_male_loans)\nX-squared = 158.85, df = 1, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.006290496 1.000000000\nsample estimates:\n   prop 1    prop 2 \n0.9985696 0.9909157 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOut test of proportions returns a p_value of less than 0.001 and so we reject our null hypothesis that proportion of funded loans is equal for both male and female borrowers. This suggests lenders' preferences lie with female borrowers in low income countries when compared to male borrowers. This could indicate evidence that lender's are motivated by a desire to improve the position of women in developing countries.\n\nLastly, we are interested in how the proportion of funded and not funded loans differ across sectors. For the purpose of this hypothesis test we will use the sector which has the highest number of loans - Food. We will use the same approach as the previous hypothesis test as we are comparing proportions. Our null and alternative hypothesis are:\n\n$H_{0} :$ $p_{funding \\ rate \\ in \\ Arts \\ sector} = p_{funding\\ rate\\ in\\ Transportation\\ sector}$\n\n$H_{1}:$ $p_{funding \\ rate \\ in \\ Arts \\ sector} > p_{funding\\ rate\\ in\\ Transportation\\ sector}$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#To choose sectors\nfunded_sector_prop <- funded_sec %>%  filter(funding_status==\"Funded\")\n\n#Subset for Food Sector\ntotal_loan_arts <-  funded_sec %>%  filter(sector == \"Arts\") %>% \n  pull(3)\ntotal_loan_transp <-  funded_sec %>%  filter(sector == \"Transportation\") %>% group_by(sector) %>% summarize(loan_count = sum(loan_count)) %>% pull(2)\n  \n  \n  \ntotal_loan_arts_funded <- funded_sector_prop %>%  filter(sector == \"Arts\") %>% \n  pull(3)\ntotal_loan_transp_funded <- funded_sector_prop %>%  filter(sector == \"Transportation\") %>% pull(3)\n\n#Test for proportions\nprop.test(x = c(total_loan_arts_funded,total_loan_transp_funded) , n = c(total_loan_arts,total_loan_transp), alternative = \"greater\", conf.level = 0.95)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\n\t2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction\n\ndata:  c(total_loan_arts_funded, total_loan_transp_funded) out of c(total_loan_arts, total_loan_transp)\nX-squared = 10.793, df = 1, p-value = 0.0005094\nalternative hypothesis: greater\n95 percent confidence interval:\n 0.006613604 1.000000000\nsample estimates:\n   prop 1    prop 2 \n1.0000000 0.9894242 \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe proportion test returns a p-value less than the 0.001 significance level and so we reject the null hypothesis that the funding rate for the Arts and Transportation sectors is the same. This indicates a potential preference of borrowers towards borrowers in the art sector. Lenders could be motivated by things related to the Arts sector. This could be purely out of interest in the arts sector, or to support new rising arts where resources are scare. We can further investigate this and look at how the gender of borrowers varies within these two sectors. This would help us strengthen our conclusion. For example, if the Arts sector has more female borrowers, this would support our previous hypothesis and suggest further evidence of lenders' motivation of a desire to improve the position of women in developing countries.\n\n## Limitations and Conclusion\n\nHypothesis testing reveals that while female borrowers have a higher funding rate, their loans are on average lower in value than the funded loans of male borrowers. Hence, while this suggests that lenders may be motivated by the idea of helping women, we cannot rule out the possibility that this phenomenon is due to lenders simply preferring the lower value loans requested by women.\n\nOur analysis has a few potential limitations. We have made a few assumptions when creating our indicator variables borrower type and funding status. It is possible that these assumptions may have filtered out some data that could have provided us with some more insight. Another limitation is the size of the observations for Not Funded loans. There are very few Not Funded loans when compared to Funded Loans and this hinders any comparison we would like to make. We need to assume that our data does not contain the entire population of Not Funded loans.\n\nFinally, we note that while we are making generalizations about lending motivations, lenders may be heterogeneous in their preferences and motivations when it comes to lending. We have aggregated our data at numerous levels which could have led to the Simpson's paradox. Future analysis could explore if these trends hold at the country and sector level.\n",
